## Description
A very simple idle game where a ball bounces around and you try to hit the sqaures on the edges to get coins and the circle in the middle to double your coins but avoid the red squares circling around the circle which remove your points. You can also press space to reset the location of your ball and to turn coins into money with which you can buy upgrades. You also get 1 money for every time space bar is pressed.
